This file will contain upcoming features for version 0.1
or simply the wish list.

1) Add Ncurses support by building a wrapper and expose an easy interface so that a developer may not have to learn Ncurses to work on this project. 
2) Use STLs for string manipulation.
3) Exception handling for taking care of the unexpected.
